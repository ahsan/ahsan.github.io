title: Functions with equivalent inverse and first derivative

As is the case with majority of my blog posts, this one is also an answer to a question that spontaneously popped up in my head one day: "Are there any functions that have the same inverse function as their first derivative?"

Spoiler alert: there are atleast two and, they're based on the golden ratio!
