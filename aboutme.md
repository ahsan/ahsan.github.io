I'm Abdullah. A twenty-something, STEM graduate, currently living in Berlin. Although terrible at playing the guitar, I _am_ good at other things. Software engineering being one of them. In my day job, I build efficient and scalable distributed systems. In this blog I write about anything and everything that interests me. Which mostly revolves around mathematics, software and embedded systems.

If you want to get in touch, you can find my contact info in this page's footer. I also try to keep my resume up to date [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/abdullahahsan/abdullah_ahsan_resume.pdf).
